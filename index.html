      <h2>Technical Details (For Developers)</h2>
      <p>Beyond the Tavern is built with the .NET MAUI framework, enabling it to run seamlessly on both Android and Windows devices. Here's a glimpse into the development considerations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>API Integration (Online Mode): Utilizes libraries like System.Net.Http to make HTTP requests to the D&D 5e API and parses JSON responses for data retrieval.</li>
        <li>Offline Mode (Optional): Implements logic for downloading and storing a local data package, potentially using SQLite or another lightweight database for efficient storage and retrieval.</li>
        <li>Error Handling: Proper error handling is implemented to address potential network connectivity issues and API calls.</li>
        <li>User Interface: A user-friendly interface is designed leveraging the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for code organization and maintainability. Data binding is utilized for easier interaction between UI elements and underlying data models. UI optimizations are considered for different screen sizes and resolutions on both Android and Windows devices.</li>
    </ul>
